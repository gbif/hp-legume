## The Legume Family

Legumes are cosmopolitan in distribution, representing important ecological constituents in almost all biomes across the globe and occur in even the most extreme habitats. They constitute significant elements in terms of both species diversity and abundance, in lowland wet tropical forests in Africa, South America, and Asia, and they dominate dry forests and savannas throughout the tropics, and also occur in Mediterranean, desert and temperate regions, up to high latitudes and at high elevations. They can be large emergent tropical trees with buttresses, small ephemeral annual herbs, climbing annuals or perennials with tendrils, desert shrubs, geoxylic subshrubs, woody lianas and, less commonly, aquatics. Flower symmetry spans the full range from radially symmetric (actinomorphic) to bilaterally symmetric (zygomorphic) and asymmetric flowers, which are in turn adapted to a wide range of pollinators such as insects, birds and bats. The ability of the majority of legume species to fix atmospheric nitrogen in symbiosis with soil rhizobia is perhaps the best-known ecological characteristic of the family; however, not all legumes form associations with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.

## Legume Phylogeny Working Group

 The Legume Phylogeny Working Group, LPWG, was established in 2010 as an informal global consortium of legume systematists to foster collaborative research in legume systematics, building on several decades of data sharing and collaboration since the first International Legume Conference organised by Roger Polhill and colleagues in 1978. While the name LPWG implies a specific focus on phylogenetics, in practice the LPWG spans a broader range of activities across legume systematics and evolution as a whole. LPWG activities have resulted in a series of collaborative papers published under the LPWG umbrella:
 
*	An overview paper in 2013 [LPWG. 2013. Legume phylogeny and classification in the 21st century: Progress, prospects and lessons for other species–rich clades. Taxon 62: 217-248.](https://doi.org/10.12705/622.8)
*	A major community-endorsed phylogenetically-based subfamily classification of the legume family in 2017 [LPWG. 2017. A new subfamily classification of the Leguminosae based on a taxonomically comprehensive phylogeny. Taxon 66: 44-77.](https://doi.org/10.12705/661.3)
*	A paper outlining a blueprint for a new legume species information system [LPWG. 2019. Towards a new online species-information system for legumes. Australian Systematic Botany 32: 495-518.](https://doi.org/10.1071/SB19025)

In May 2020, an informal pop-up meeting of a subset of the LPWG led to the establishment of four new working groups under the LPWG umbrella. These working groups are focused on Taxonomy, Phylogenomics, Occurrence Data, and Functional Trait Data, and have been established with a view to further stimulating and coordinating large-scale collaborative family-wide data assembly and analyses. 

It is important to note that these working groups are open to wider participation by all! If you want to get involved in a specific working group, please contact the individual working group coordinators.
