## Introduction 
Subfamily Duparquetioideae includes the single species *Duparquetia orchidacea*. This unusual West African species forms a distinct lineage in all phylogenetic analyses with no obvious closest relatives. Recent phylogenetic analyses resolve subfamily Duparquetioideae as sister to the clade formed by Papilioinoideae, Caesalpinioideae and Dialiodeae.

## Key Features
Morphologically subfamily Duparquetioideae is unique in the family. *Duparquetia* is a liana with imparipinnate leaves, a racemose inflorescence, zygomorphic flowers, and a woody, elastically dehiscent pod. In *Duparquetia* flowers the vexillary petal is exterior in bud, a characteristic which generally is found only in subfamily Papilionoideae. The morphology, ultrastructure and development of *Duparquetia* pollen are also unusual, not only in the Leguminosae, but among the eudicots. Finally, the species lacks vestured pits in the wood vessels, a feature that is present in most Leguminosae except Cercidoideae and most Dialioideae. 

## Distribution and Ecology
*Duparquetia orchidacea* is endemic to tropical humid forests of Central and West Africa.

## Formal Botanical Description
As published in LPWG (2017), Taxon 66: 44-77, doi.org/10.12705/661.3

Subfam. Duparquetioideae Legume Phylogeny Working Group, stat. nov. ≡ Duparquetiinae H.S.Irwin & Barneby in Polhill & Raven, Adv. Legume Syst. 1: 102. 1981.

Type: *Duparquetia* Baill.

Unarmed, scrambling liana, often climbing to the forest canopy; specialised extrafloral nectaries lacking on petiole and leaf rachis. Stipules in lateral position, free, narrowly triangular. Leaves imparipinnate, pulvinate, leaflets opposite, exstipellate. Inflorescence a terminal, erect, 10–30-flowered raceme; bracteoles 2, small. Flowers bisexual, strongly bilaterally symmetrical, hypanthium lacking; sepals 4, unequal, the abaxial and adaxial sepals cucullate, sepaloid, the lateral sepals petaloid; petals 5, free, dimorphic, the adaxial and the two lateral petals ovate, two abaxial petals strap-like, oblong, all 5 petals with stalked gland-like extrusions along their margins, imbricate, the adaxial petal outermost; stamens 4, the anthers basifixed, oblong, with pointed appendages, the thecae dehisce by a short, apical, poricidal slit, the anthers postgenitally fused into a curving synandrium, the appendages remain free; pollen in monads, asymmetrical, one equatorial-encircling ectoaperture with two equatorial endoapertures; gynoecium 1-carpellate, stipitate, 2–5-ovuled, with four ridges running along the length of the ovary. Fruit an oblong four-angled, woody pod, dehiscent, valves spirally coiled. Seeds 2–5 per fruit, oblong to ovoid, the testa thick; embryo straight. Vestured pits lacking in secondary xylem; silica bodies, septate fibres and storeyed rays absent. Root nodules absent. Chromosome number unknown.
