## Introduction
Caesalpinioideae, which includes the nested mimosoid clade (former subfamily Mimosoideae), comprises 163 genera and c. 4680 species, with c. 75% of the species in the mimosoid clade. Recent phylogenomic work provides a robust phylogenomic backbone for a new tribal classification of Caesalpinioideae, which is forthcoming soon. 

Caesalpinioideae date to the late Paleocene when the subfamily is known from fossil bipinnate leaves from Colombia. These fossils indicate that Caesalpinioideae were already an abundant element in the earliest Neotropical rain forests in the Paleocene and started to diversify around 58 million years ago. Caesalpinioideae have thus diversified throughout the Cenozoic and now comprise diverse, abundant, and sometimes dominant elements across all major lowland tropical biomes, including tropical rain forests, savannas and seasonally dry tropical forests. 

The Caesalpinioideae include some of the largest genera in the legume family, including *Acacia*, with > 1,000 species concentrated in arid parts of Australia, and *Mimosa* with 615 species mostly in the Neotropics. Other species-rich genera include *Inga* with c. 300 species restricted to the Neotropics almost entirely in rainforests, the pantropical *Chamaecrista* (361 species) and *Senna* (287 species), whose highest diversity is found in the Neotropics, as well as *Vachellia* (164 species) and *Senegalia* (219 species), two pantropical genera concentrated in drier environments, within which the iconic umbrella-crown trees of savannas, especially in Africa, are found.


## Key Features
Caesalpinioideae are almost entirely woody perennials, but within those bounds they are extremely diverse in stature and habit – including lianas, trees of all sizes up to rain forest canopy emergents (e.g., *Cedrelinga*, *Dinizia*), shrubs and functionally herbaceous geoxyles. A handful of herbaceous aquatics are found in the genus [*Neptunia*](https://www.gbif.org/species/7599660).

Caesalpinioideae is the only legume subfamily which has bipinnate leaves, which are prevalent but nor universal across the subfamily. Some genera have species with pinnate leaves, and leaves modified into phyllodes occur in the majority of species of the large genus *Acacia* and a few species in other genera including *Senna* and *Mimosa*. There is considerable quantitative variation in leaf dimensions and dividedness of leaves and especially the bipinnate leaf, from the massive leaves of e.g. *Schizolobium* (> 1m long), to highly reduced leaves and even aphyllous species (e.g. *Prosopis kuntzei*).

Nyctinastic leaf movements are common across all legumes, including Caesalpinioideae, but seismonasty, i.e. leaf movements that are prompted by touch, are only known within subfamily Caesalpinioideae in the genera *Neptunia* and *Mimosa*. The latter was referred to as *Sensitivae Censitae* by Rupert Barneby in his monograph of New World *Mimosa*, and *Mimosa pudica* has come to be grown as a pet house plant.

Extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) are usually present, and often conspicuous and abundant, on the petiole and/or the primary or secondary leaf rachises between pinnae or leaflet pairs in the majority of Caesalpinioideae. Indeed, it is within subfamily Caesalpinioideae, and especially the mimosoid clade, where the greatest concentration, diversity and abundance of EFN-possessing taxa within the legumes occur. Within the mimosoid clade, 90% of the 100 genera that are currently recognised possess EFNs. 

Within Caesalpinioideae, some of the best-studied legume myrmecophytes, i.e. true ant plants with domatia, are found, including the emblematic swollen-thorn ant ‘acacias’ in the genus *Vachellia* in Africa and the Neotropics and in the genus *Tachigali*, albeit, in the latter case, the mutualism lacks EFNs. The Neotropical *Vachellia* myrmecophyte lineage with 12 species is often cited as one of the best-studied examples of co-evolution involving an obligate symbiotic mutualism between the *Pseudomyrmex ferrugineus* group of c. 10 species of ants that all nest exclusively in the swollen stipular spine domatia of *Vachellia* species. In return, the nectar from the multiple conspicuous EFNs on the petiole and leaf rachis, as well as specialised beltian food bodies on the tips of the leaflets, are specific for the resident ants.

Caesalpinioideae are commonly, but far from universally, armed with prickles or nodal / infranodal spines. Within the mimosoid clade, armature is restricted to the core mimosoid clade. Armature is highly variable, even among congeneric species. For example, within the small genus *Parkinsonia* trees can be completely unarmed, have stipular spines or spinescent leaf rachises.

Across the subfamily, inflorescences and flowers are also morphologically highly variable. Flowers are generally radially symmetrical in the mimosoid clade, but in some clades of Caesalpinioideae they are bilaterally symmetrical or asymmetrical. In the mimosoid clade, there is a progressive trend to reduced size of the perianth parts and showy exserted stamen filaments, with inflorescences rather than individual flowers taking over as the unit of pollinator attraction. The mimosoid clade has characteristic globose capitulate or spicate and frequently heteromorphic inflorescences often with sterile flowers which sometimes become showy staminodia. While a large majority of Caesalpinioideae flowers are bee pollinated, specialized bat and moth pollinated flowers are also common, especially in some largely night-flowering genera, such as *Calliandra* and *Inga*, in the ingoid clade.
Caesalpinioideae is the only subfamily of legumes where pollen is arranged in polyads. These are extremely variable across and sometimes within genera, with pollen in monads, tetrads, bitetrads and polyads. 

Caesalpinioideae are prominent, diverse and sometimes dominant in savannas. Many species show striking fire adaptations, including thick corky bark and functionally herbaceous geoxyle habit with large underground lignotubers or xylopodia.

One of the hallmarks of Caesalpinioideae, like many plant groups, are repeated morphological and ecological convergences whereby similar leaf, flower and fruit morphologies have been reinvented multiple times across the phylogeny. This is especially notable among fruits of the mimosoid clade which have proved misleading for generic delimitation, and which reflect selection pressures for different seed dispersal syndromes, including passive and explosive dehiscence, water, wind, large herbivores, ants, and birds.


## Distribution and Ecology
The vast majority of Caesalpinioideae diversity is tropical, but a small fraction of species extend to the warm temperate zone, a subset of which are frost tolerant (*Gleditsia*, *Gymnocladus*, some *Desmanthus*). Caesalpinioideae are infrequent above 2500 m in the tropics and are largely absent from mid- and high-elevation tropical montane forests. Generic diversity is highest in the Neotropics, and there are important centres of high species diversity in Mexico / Central America, lowland South America, Africa, Madagascar, parts of SE Asia and Australia.
