*The Bean Bag* started in 1974 on the initiative of Charles (Bob) Gunn and Richard Cowan and the first printed issue was distributed over 40 years ago in May 1975.

The aim of the annual newsletter has been to keep legume researchers informed and updated about new publications, events and projects on the family Leguminosae.

Electronic mailing through the BB Google Group and the BB WordPress makes communication and distribution of the Bean Bag more efficient and economic.
