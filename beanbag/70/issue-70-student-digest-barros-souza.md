## Different modes of trait evolution weave a rich tapestry of functional diversity in the Neotropics

The astonishing functional diversity of neotropical ecosystems has been largely attributed to the dynamics of major geological and climatic events. The uplift of the Andes, Pleistocene climatic oscillations,decline in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, and Miocene marine flooding, all resulted in new ecosystems and biomes and also drove trait evolution. For example, the increasing dominance of flammable grasses, attributed ultimately to drops in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels (Jaramillo, 2023): triggered the assembly of the young South American savannas, resulting in *in situ* adaptations to fire in numerous independent plant lineages (Simon *et al.*, 2009). On the other hand, pre-existing traits may also have enabled lineages to colonise new environments, provided those traits conferred fitness advantages in those environments (i.e., pre-adaptation, or 'exaptation' *sensu* Gould & Vrba, 1982). Aerial roots in mangrove species, for example, probably arose as the result of selection for oxygen transport and nutrient uptake in non-mangrove saline habitats, and were only later co-opted as support structures in mangroves (Sahu *et al.*, 2016). Therefore, both adaptation and pre-adaptation can lead to optimal ecological performance through trait-environment matching.  

In a recent paper published in *Global Ecology and Biogeography*, Velásquez-Puentes *et al.* (2023) addressed whether trait and environmental niche evolution are correlated and what is the primary mode of trait evolution relative to environment. To answer these questions, they focused on the genus *Swartzia* Schreb. (Leguminosae, Papilionoideae): an emblematic neotropical legume radiation. *Swartzia* provides a suitable model to investigate trait-environment patterns and their underlying causes due to its high species and morphological diversity and relatively wide geographic distribution predominantly in rain forests, but also in other biomes, such as savannas and dry forests (Torke and Schaal, 2008). Velásquez-Puentes *et al.* hypothesised that (**H1**) trait-environment matching is evident in *Swartzia*; (**H2**) trait and environmental niche evolution are correlated; and (**H3**) pre-adaptation is the predominant mode underlying trait-environment matching. The authors reconstructed a phylogeny sampling 89 *Swartzia* taxa (ca. 40% of the total) and assembled trait and environmental data encompassing leaflet, fruit, and petal trait dimensions and water deficit, soil texture, soil fertility, and temperature environmental factors. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, Velásquez-Puentes *et al.* found a positive correlation between leaflet area and annual precipitation/temperature, and a negative correlation between petal width and annual temperature, supporting **H1**. They also found strong support for correlated evolution between leaflet size, presence or absence of petals, and climate niche evolution, suggesting that transitions between trait states are contingent on transitions between environmental states (**H2**). Finally, leaflet size shifts preceded environmental shifts (pre-adaptation) while shifts between presence and absence of petals follow environmental shifts (adaptation): suggesting that both adaptation and pre-adaptation shaped morphological diversity in *Swartzia* (**H3**). Neither fruit dimensions nor soil data showed a significant match with any other factor. Nonetheless, their results show that trait-environment matching shapes trait diversity in *Swartzia* and that trait evolution followed complex macroevolutionary trajectories in which *Swartzia* lineages evolved morphologically either by tracking abiotic conditions to which they were adapted or by adapting following transitions to new environments.

But what are the ecological associations that shaped these trait-environment correlations and what evolutionary mechanisms drove these distinct modes of trait evolution in *Swartzia*? Because the evolution of large and small leaflets facilitated transitions to wetter/warmer and drier/colder environments, the authors suggested that water and temperature stress impose limitations on leaflet size. Their results support a pre-adaptive mode of leaflet size evolution, suggesting that the current functional significance of different leaflet sizes may be distinct from the function they were originally selected for. Velásquez-Puentes *et al.* suggested that small leaflets, which can be an adaptation to drought (Bacelar *et al.*, 2004): probably evolved first within rainforests, thereby facilitating subsequent colonisation of drier areas. Although the initial pressure for smaller leaflets in wet habitats is unknown, the authors suggested that local climatic gradients, genetic constraints, and/or herbivory may have influenced variation in leaflet size in rainforests. In contrast with leaf evolution, Velásquez-Puentes *et al*. found evidence for an adaptive mode of evolutionary loss of petals contingent on temperature, as S*wartzia* lineages lost petals only after colonisation of warmer habitats. This suggests that petal loss may be under positive selection due to heat stress and herbivory, as large petals may not be as efficient as small petals for heat regulation via transpiration (Descamps *et al.*, 2020) and higher temperatures may increase herbivory (Hamman *et al.*, 2021). Additionally, petal loss is common when pollinator-mediated selective pressures are absent due to evolution of other means to attract pollinators (Zhang *et al.*, 2013). Indeed, pollination attraction in *Swartzia* is strongly mediated by visual cues (dimorphic stamens) and chemical signals (Basso-Alves *et al.*, 2022).  

Velásquez-Puentes *et al.* provide robust evidence that both adaptation and pre-adaptation shaped trait diversity and lineage composition of *Swartzia* across the Neotropics. Historical biogeographic origins of *Swartzia* in Amazonian rainforests and later dispersals and adaptations to adjacent habitats, is common in many plant and animal groups (Antonelli *et al.*, 2018). Velásquez-Puentes *et al.* pave the way for future research to investigate whether different modes of trait evolution occur in a concerted way to shape the astonishingly high functional diversity of the Neotropics as a whole.
