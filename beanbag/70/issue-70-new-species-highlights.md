# LEGUME DISCOVERIES AND NEW SPECIES HIGHLIGHTS 2023

**Colin Hughes** (University of Zurich, Switzerland)  

Surveying the suite of new legume species discoveries and descriptions published in 2023, it is apparent that legume revisionary taxonomy is very much alive and well. Not only did we see another substantial clutch of interesting new legume species described during the year, but the data and evidence underpinning these newly delimitated taxa, and the abundance and quality of illustrations and photos accompanying them, are extremely impressive. It is now almost universal for new species to be accompanied by comprehensive sets of high-quality photographs, and here in the New Legume Species Highlights section we present a subset of these photos, illustrating once again the exceptional and spectacular diversity of legumes from all corners of the globe.  

## Two new Ironwoods from northern Australia

Traditionally a single species of *Erythrophleum* has been recognised in Australia, but a recent study by Barrett and Barrett (2023) added two new segregate species. None of the three species now recognised is rare and all three are conspicuous trees, begging the question as to why these two new species have only come to light now. The reason is the considerable variation in leaf morphology among seedlings, resprout shoots and adult trees which has generated confusion. More careful tallying of this variation showed that there are three distinct and readily diagnosable species and this is corroborated by molecular, geographical and ecological evidence. All three species are adapted to withstand fire through their thick bark and by resprouting and grow in savanna woodlands in northern Australia. The Barrett and Barrett paper presents a detailed revision of the genus in Australia with maps, numerous photos, and extensive data on uses and phytochemistry.

## *Baphia arenicola*: a new geoxyle from Kalahari sand savannas in central Angola

The c. 50 species of the genus *Baphia* across tropical Africa are almost all shrubs or small trees of woodlands, forests and savannas. However, *B. arenicola*, recently described by Goyder et al. (2023) from the Kalahari sand savannas of central Angola, is quite different. This unusual species is a geoxylic suffrutex forming large mats arising from extensive woody below-ground stems which comprise considerable underground woody biomass. Species of geoxyle habit, characterised by Frank White as forming the *underground forests of Africa*, are generally considered adaptations to fire and / or frost. The grasslands where *B. arenicola* occurs are rich in geoxyles and are found on fossil river terraces of white, highly leached sands, largely devoid of nutrients. Like other species of *Baphia*, this new species also has unifoliolate leaves.

## *Androcalymma* rediscovered after 86 years

The rediscovery of the long-lost and very poorly understood genus *Androcalymma* (subfamily Dialioideae) reported in a paper by Falcão et al. published in 2023 is one of the highlights of the legume year. *Androcalymma glabrifolium* is the only species in its genus. First collected by Krukoff in Brazilian Amazon in 1936, the genus was described by Dwyer in 1958 based on its unusual hood-shaped anthers. Known only from the type and one other collection, from close to the indigenous village of Belém do Solimões, of the Ticuna people in the heart of the Amazon close to the border between Brazil, Colombia, and Peru, it was not seen again for 86 years. In 2022 the species (and genus) was rediscovered during an expedition by Falcão et al. to an area of indigenous lands on the Solimões River.  

Until this rediscovery, the genus had remained poorly-known and was even considered to possibly be extinct. This rediscovery allowed new collections and field observations to be made and photographs to be obtained. Now the fruits of this large 30-40m tall tree of primary terra firme forests have been described for the first time, together with the shape and colour of its flowers. These new field collections also provided DNA for sequencing, enabling *Androcalymma* to be included in the Dialioideae phylogeny for the first time, and revealing it to be sister to the genus *Dicorynia*, which is also from Amazonia. As currently known *Androcalymma* is extremely narrowly restricted geographically, from an area of just 8km2, and was assigned an IUCN Threat Category of Critically Endangered. The paper by Falcão et al. presents a beautifully detailed portrait of the ecology, distribution, morphology and phylogenetic relationships of this long-lost genus of legumes.

## 18 new *Indigofera* species from southern Africa

The majority of new legume species being described in the modern era belong to species-rich genera and are narrowly restricted endemics, two trends that make sense as the inventory of species progresses. The genus *Indigofera*, with c.750 species globally, epitomises these trends with a steady on-going stream of new species being described, many of which are geographically restricted. Based on extensive field and herbarium work a suite of papers describing new South African Indigoferas have been published during 2023. Nine new species of *Indigofera* from the Greater Cape Floristic Region were described by Du Preez et al. (2023a,b); another nine new species from the Pondoland region of southern Africa were added by Grieve et al. (2023, 2024). All of these new species are extensively illustrated, including an abundance of photos; detailed distribution maps are presented. These increments bring the tally of species of *Indigofera* from the Greater Cape Floristic Region to around 100, 86 of which belong to a single 'Cape Clade'. They also attest to the unusual ecological amplitude of the genus spanning almost every seasonally dry habitat across southern Africa. These novelties reflect the diversity of life histories of the genus in that region: *I. barkeri* is a dwarf annual herb, 5-20 cm tall, with trifoliolate leaves, *I. pondoensis* is an erect muti-stemmed suffrutex, *I. tanquana* is a thick-stemmed shrub with spinescent branches, and *I. vanwykii* is an erect woody shrub to 2 m ht. Grieve et al. suggest that 80 to 90 species of *Indigofera* from South Africa still remain to be described.

## Flying-buttressed *Monopteryx* trees in Amazonia

As part of a detailed and amply illustrated taxonomic account of the small Amazonian tree genus *Monopteryx* by Carvalho et al. (2023), the species *M. inpae* W.A.Rodrigues ex C.S.Carvalho, H.C.Lima & D.B.O.S.Cardoso is newly described to occupy the place of *M. inpae* W.A.Rodrigues, a name misapplied and not validly published. Even though this species does not represent a brand-new species discovery, it is highlighted here in the Bean Bag as a very interesting, unusual, and poorly known legume genus of giant rainforest trees. First, *Monopteryx* trees have unusual flattened, board-like, much-branched, flying buttresses which form arches from the elevated base of the trunk to the ground, which are unique among Amazonian buttressed leguminous trees. Second, *Monopteryx* species have unusual bilaterally symmetrical but not truly papilionate flowers.

## Nine new tree species of *Dalbergia* from Madagascar

The on-going large-scale description of new species of *Dalbergia* from Madagascar, which we reported on in last year's Bean Bag, represents a fascinating story in modern plant systematics. This Madagascan *Dalbergia* inventory initiative benefits from a very densely sampled phylogeny which is based on sequencing \> 2000 nuclear genes for 683 accessions of *Dalbergia* from Madagascar, alongside morphological assessment of \> 5,000 field collections, i.e., it is one of the most thorough attempts to combine large scale molecular data with morphology for species delimitation for any legume group undertaken to date. Forty-three species of *Dalbergia* were recognised in the *Legumes of Madagascar* book published in 2002. Twenty years later the tally of *Dalbergia* species for Madagascar is up to 64, including eight species newly described this year by Wilding et al. (2023) and one by Rakotonirina et al. (2023). All nine of these new species form trees large enough to have commercial potential for exploitation of their highly-prized and valuable hardwood, the rosewoods. Eight of these new species are judged to be threatened. Seven more new species of *Dalbergia* from Madagascar are in the pipeline. Completing the species inventory for *Dalbergia* is especially important given the massive increase in illegal and unsustainable exploitation of precious woods which prompted CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) to place Malagasy species of *Dalbergia* on its Appendix II in 2013, resulting in a total embargo on international trade. Any future exploitation of rosewoods needs to be based on an accurate inventory of species, where they grow, how threatened they are, and how they can be identified, and the Madagascar *Dalbergia* inventory is making impressive strides towards achieving that.

## *Macrolobium paulobocae*

*Macrolobium* is the second most species-rich genus in subfamily Detarioideae, with c. 75 species, most of which are distributed in the Amazon. The genus is ecologically important; some species growing as hyper-dominants and most species grow mainly on oligotrophic soils of white-sand vegetation, and seasonally inundated black-water floodplain forests known as *igapó*, including the species newly described by Farroñay et al. (2023), *M. paulobocae*. The species was named in honour of the Brazilian botanist Paulo Apóstolo Costa Lima Assunção (1956--2021), better known in the botanical world as "Paulo Boca", an expert of the Amazonia flora. *Macrolobium paulobocae* is known from just eight collections, from the Urubú, Marmelos, and Manicoré tributaries of the Amazon and was considered Endangered by the authors.

## Three new and globally rare species of *Millettia*

It is to be expected that the majority of plant species remaining to be described are likely to be globally rare, simply because most of the common species have already been discovered. This means that many newly described species are categorised as threatened at the time of description. This is very much the case for three new species of the genus *Millettia* from south-east Asia described by Mattapha et al. (2023). Each of these three species is known from just a single locality, two in Thailand and one from Vietnam. One of these is categorised as Critically Endangered, a second is likely to be so, and the third lacks sufficient data to assign an IUCN threat category at this time. Even as these new species are added, the genus *Millettia* remains in need of major taxonomic revision and is almost certainly polyphyletic.

## *Acacia*: the census continues

The genus *Acacia* is Australia's most species-rich genus and, after *Astragalus*, the second-most species-rich genus of legumes. Just as for other large legume genera such as *Indigofera* (see above), or *Mimosa*, new species of *Acacia* continue to be described at a steady rate, most of them very narrowly restricted endemics. In western Australia, an important centre of species diversity for the genus, 390 species of *Acacia* have been described in the last 50 years, many as a result of intensive taxonomic work in the region by Bruce Maslin, but there are still on-going increments. Indeed, Thiele et al. (2023) suggest that around 75 informally-named and incompletely-known species remain to be dealt with from this region. *Acacia armigera* is one such entity, first collected in 2015, and now formally named following collection of complete material. *Acacia armigera* is so named for its rigid finely acicular armed phyllodes which together with the dense, rigid, highly-branched crown, form formidably armed shrubs.
