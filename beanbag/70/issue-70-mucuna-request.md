# *MUCUNA* MONOGRAPH

**Gwilym Lewis** (Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew)  

Gwilym Lewis, TÃ¢nia Moura and Helen Hopkins, with contributions from several other international colleagues, are putting together data for a monograph of the pantropical papilionoid genus *Mucuna*, which currently comprises 111 species.

Flowers of species of *Mucuna*. Clockwise from top left: *Mucuna championii* (photo: Stephan Gale), *M. gigantea* (photo: Tim Utteridge), *M. novoguineensis* (photo: Tim Utteridge), *M. macrocarpa* (photo: Peter Wilkie).  

We seek high quality photographs, line drawings and colour paintings of *Mucuna* inflorescences, flowers, fruits, and seeds. And photos of habit and habitat. If you have images that you would be willing to share, we would love to hear from you.  

We are also compiling information on uses, common names, and published *Mucuna* references, so if you know of any unpublished, or otherwise difficult to access, data on the genus please get in touch with Gwilym Lewis (<G.Lewis@kew.org>).
