# LEGUME PHYLOGENY WORKING GROUP REPORTS

The Legume Phylogeny Working Group (LPWG) is motivated to continue enhancing our understanding of the legumes. To take our knowledge forward, four informal working groups -- Taxonomy, Phylogenetics, Occurrence Data, and Trait Data -- were established in 2020 to promote collaboration and synthesis, each with their own focus and role to contribute towards the bigger picture. In addition, around the same time, the Legume Data Portal was established as a means of making data, knowledge, information and news about legumes widely available. Reports from the four working groups, plus the Legume Data Portal are presented here.  

These informal working groups are evolving and merit on-going discussion across the legume community to ensure that they remain useful and relevant. For example, a subgroup is developing the legume Tree of Life (ToL) to underpin the Legume Data Portal.
