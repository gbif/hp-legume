# THE LEGUME PHYLOGENY WORKING GROUP

*The Legume Phylogeny Working Group* (LPWG) was founded in 2010 with the objective of fostering collaboration and facilitating sharing of material, data and ideas amongst legume systematics researchers. While the initial focus of the LPWG was very much on phylogeny, its remit is wider, and covers all aspects of legume systematics and evolution. Reflecting this broad focus, in May 2020, four LPWG subgroups — Taxonomy, Occurrence Data, Traits and Phylogenomics — were established to advance research collabo- ration in these four areas which were considered of particular importance to understand the systematics and evolution of legumes. In addition, a new Legume Data Portal was established in 2021 (<https://www.legumedata.org/>). Updates and progress reports from the working groups are presented below with the aim of encouraging other researchers to collaborate and contribute.

Anyone who is interested in collaborating with one or other of the Working Groups and projects is encouraged to contact the relevant working group coordinators (see below).
