# NEW LEGUME SPECIES HIGHLIGHTS 2022

**Colin Hughes** (University of Zürich, Switzerland)

***The census of new legume species published in 2022*** mirrors the diversity of the legume family as a whole. It includes shrubs from mid-elevation oak forests in central Mexico, two endangered rosewood trees from Madagascar, a giant rainforest tree from the Atlantic forests of Brazil, a tree that is seasonally almost submerged in flooded forests in the Amazon basin, a prostrate dwarf shrub from dry valleys of Yunnan in SW China, a woody climber from deciduous tropical forests in Laos, SE Asia, several geoxyles from the fire-prone Cerrado savannas of South America, a set of prostrate herbaceous perennials from tropical Australian grasslands and Eucalyptus woodland, a putative hybrid forming a large tree in urban Singapore, and a rare shrub from a remote area of the Blue Mountains in Australia. In other words, amongst these 2022 novelties we have a representative snapshot of the overall diversity of growth forms, biomes, and geographic ranges found across legumes as a whole. The species highlighted here provide a flavour of the new discoveries of 2022. A full list of taxonomic papers is in the 2022 Legume Bibliography at the end of this issue of the Bean Bag.

## Two new *Brongniartia* species narrowly endemic within the Río Balsas Depression in Mexico

Of the c. 60 species of *Brongniartia* (Papilionoideae, Brongniartieae) all but one are distributed in Mexico. The majority of species are shrubs in seasonally dry tropical forests and mid-elevation oak and pine-oak forests. The two new species highlighted here, *B. alvarezii* R. Cruz-Durán, R. Bustamante & Dorado and *B. variabilis* Dorado, R. Cruz-Durán & R. Bustamante add to the already impressive tally of narrowly restricted endemic *Brongniartias* concentrated in the Río Balsas Depression, especially in the State of Guerrero in Mexico which is a hotspot for the genus. Flowers of *Brongniartia* species are typically coppery maroon; *B. alvarezii* is the second species of the genus with cream-white flowers joining the outlier species *B. ulbrichiana* from S. America which also has pale yellowish flowers.

## Two new Endangered species of *Dalbergia* from Madagascar

Given the international interest and high level of conservation concern surrounding many species of the genus *Dalbergia* (Papilionoideae, Dalbergieae), it is more important than ever that the diversity of species in the genus is well documented. In other words, we need to know how many species there are, where they grow and what their conservation status is, based on rigorous taxonomic evidence, in order to develop plans for their sustainable management. This is because many *Dalbergia* species form durable and beautifully coloured heartwood, so-called rosewoods, which are highly valued for making musical instruments and furniture. Demand for these precious woods means that several species have been subjected to intense, unsustainable, and often illegal logging. As a result, almost all species of *Dalbergia* are listed in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).

The genus *Dalbergia* comprises c. 270 species and occupies a pantropical distribution. At least 48 species occur in Madagascar, all but one of them endemic, representing an exceptional hotspot of diversity within the genus. This flock of Madagascan species is the focus of intensive new phylogenomic and population genomic analyses based on more than 600 accessions of Malagasy *Dalbergia* including all the Madagascan species and representing their intraspecific diversity, carried out by Simon Crameri during his PhD at the University of Zurich in collaboration with the Madagascar Precious Woods Project at Missouri Botanical Garden (https://discoverandshare.org/2022/02/10/protecting-precious-woods-in-madagascar/). This prodigious field sampling and DNA sequencing is revealing that a subset of Madagascan species are polyphyletic, prompting description of additional species, including *Dalbergia pseudomaritima* Crameri, Phillipson & N. Wilding and *D. razakamalala* Crameri, Phillipson & N. Wilding, from eastern Madagascar, both of which are categorized as Endangered. It seems that the number of Madagascan *Dalbergia* species has been substantially under-estimated and that more new species are in the pipeline.
