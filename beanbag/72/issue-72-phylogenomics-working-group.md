# Phylogenomics Working Group

Coordinator: **Felix Forest** (Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, UK)
<br>
<br>

The Legume Phylogeny Working Group is looking for volunteers to take over the coordination of the Phylogenomics Working Group.

This working group aims to bring together information on legume phylogenomics published along the year, and, most importantly, currently underway. Promoting coordination among different groups of researchers generating phylogenomic data is paramount to allow future merging of datasets, thus supporting broad scale analyses across legumes as a whole.

In previous years, two people served as coordinators, but a larger group including at least one representative for the larger subfamilies may better capture the diversity of ongoing sequencing initiatives.

If you would like to contribute, please write to Felix Forest (<F.Forest@kew.org>) and Leo Borges (<aquitemcaqui@gmail.com>).
