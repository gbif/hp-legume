# TRAITS WORKING GROUP

Coordinators: **Leonardo Borges** (Universidade Federal de São Carlos, Brazil) & **Renske Onstein** (Naturalis Biodiversity Centre, Netherlands & German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research, iDiv, Germany)

In 2024 the Traits Working Group was not as active as in previous years. Nonetheless, we've noticed the efforts towards documentation of the diversity and understanding of the ecology and evolution of legume traits.

Many papers were published on this subject, a number of them in the [Advances in Legume Systematics 15](<https://link.springer.com/collections/fhbbcjdidd>), as well as others listed in this volume's [Legume Bibliography](/beanbag/72/legume-bibliography-2025.md). A few interesting examples are [Zalko 2025](https://doi.org/10.1007/s40415-024-01044-5), linking vascular anatomy and development in _Swartzia_; [Dörken et al. (2025)](https://doi.org/10.1093/botlinnean/boae065), on the morphology and development of *Jackonia* phyloclades (photosynthetic plane branches); [Huang et al. (2025)](https://doi.org/10.1002/ajb2.70105), unraveling the relationship between leaf traits, phylogeny and environment of Chinese legumes; and [Monteiro et al. (2025)](https://doi.org/10.1093/botlinnean/boaf104) investigation of evolutionary trade-offs in flowers of the Adesmia clade (Dalbergieae, Papilionoideae).

Two news shared with us this year may be of interest to the wide legume community. First, Prof. Charles Stirton  communicated the establishment of a small working group focused on traits of tribes Psoraleeae, Indigofereae and Crotalarieae in the Cape Region of Southern Africa. Their main goal is to understand trait evolution across these tribes using a newly generated phylogenomic tree. We strongly support the formation of such groups, which surely facilitate data collections across the different legume clades. Second, Meghan Forde (Missouri Botanical Garden, USA) is starting a project on legume seed traits. Besides a must needed update to the works by Gunn (1984) and Kirkbride et al. (2003), her research may unlock interesting knowledge on the diversity and evolution of legume seeds.

Looking ahead to 2026, we plan to have an online meeting with all coleagues interested in legume traits. The main goal of the meeting is to share updates on current research projects, understand the aims of different researchers, and, as always, to promote collaboration.  

The meeting will happen between May and June. The exact date will be annouced soon to all those interested in attending. If you would like to participate, [please fill this form](https://forms.gle/tNnSKr4Rm1huCzVR7). We hope to meet you there!
