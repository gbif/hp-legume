The Rupert Barneby Award, named in honor of the late NYBG scientist and renowned legume expert, consists of US$2000 granted to assist researchers to visit the New York Botanical Garden to study the rich herbarium collection of Fabaceae. Graduate students and early career professionals with research in systematics and/or legume diversity are given special consideration. Projects that will result in the improved curation of the collection are desirable.

Anyone interested in applying for the award should submit the following: 1) curriculum vitae; 2) a proposal describing the project for which the award is sought; 3) contact information for two individuals who can vouch for the qualifications of the applicant.

The proposal should address specifically the activities to be performed at NYBG and should consist of four parts: 1) title page with proposal title, applicant's name, address, and e-mail address; 2) body of the proposal of no more than two pages, including justification, objectives, and research plan; 3) literature cited; 4) travel budget.

Please email your application to Dr. Benjamin M. Torke (btorke@nybg.org) no later than April 1, 2026 for consideration for the upcoming Award.

Announcement of the recipient will be made in May of 2026. Travel to NYBG should be planned for some period after July 1, 2026 and before June 30, 2027. Recipients are asked to give a presentation about their research.
