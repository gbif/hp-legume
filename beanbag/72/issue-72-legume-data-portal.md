# LEGUME DATA PORTAL

The Legume Data Portal (<https://www.legumedata.org>) continues to actively publish news from the legume systematics community, such as the [Bean Bag Issues](<https://www.legumedata.org/beanbag/issues>), and to host updated versions of the [legume species checklist](<https://www.legumedata.org/taxonomy/species-list>). We also update as required the instructions on how to contribute to verifying this list (see [the checklist guidelines](<https://www.legumedata.org/post/2024/taxonomychecklistprocedures/>) and the Taxonomy Working Group report).

The Legume Data Portal, supported by [Canadensys](<https://www.canadensys.net>) and [GBIF](<https://www.gbif.org/>), runs as an instance of GBIF's [hosted portal service](<https://www.gbif.org/hosted-portals>). The portal is currently available in English, French and Portuguese (in part). We remain keenly interested in seeing the translation of the portal into Spanish. If you wish to help on translations into Portuguese or Spanish, or if you would like to contribute to content, please contact us! There is tremendous scope to expand the Portal with other sorts of legume data beyond the current legume species checklist and species occurrence data.

During the year, we quietly added a [new dashboard](<https://www.legumedata.org/occurrence/search?view=dashboard>) to the Data Occurrences page that allows you to create a view using specific filters, such as the country of origin or the year of collection, with graphics or lists. It is a great tool to create a visual summary of information about your group of interest. Try it out!

We thought Bean Bag readers might also be interested in seeing the use statistics for the Legume Data Portal for the past two years. These show that LDP has been visited 44 879 times, and the vast majority of users are using the Occurrences search page. The Taxonomy pages and the Subfamily pages are also at the top of those visited by users.

In 2026 GBIF will be investigating methods of displaying multiple phylogenies in the portal. If you have a phylogeny and want to see it on the portal, please contact Joe Miller (<jmiller@gbif.org>).

Send us your news items and announcements (outstanding publications, new projects, positions available in your legume research group, meetings, activities, etc.) to post on the Legume Data Portal. News items get published regularly on the Portal alongside the annual Bean Bag Newsletter. The entire community appreciates your contributions.
