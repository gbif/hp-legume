# News on the 9th International Legume Conference (9ILC)

Following the success of the 8th International Legume Conference (8ILC) in Brazil, the legume community looks forward to its next meeting. We are delighted to announce that China will host the 9th International Legume Conference (9ILC). 
	**The 9ILC will take place at the Kunming Institute of Botany (KIB), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)**, located in Yunnan province—a renowned plant kingdom harboring 19,333 land plant species, representing approximately 50.1% of China’s total plant diversity. KIB is dedicated to research in the fields of Botany and Phytochemistry, with botanical work focusing primarily on plant taxonomy, diversity, evolution, and systematics. 
	Holding the 9ILC in China highlights the significant contributions of Chinese scientists to legume research, and reinforces the strong commitment of KIB and CAS to promote global scientific collaboration. We envision 9ILC as a premier in-person international conference providing an inclusive platform for researchers worldwide to share advances across legume biology, genomics, systematics, biogeography, ecology, and applied sciences.
	The conference is provisionally scheduled for **July 2027**. We cordially invite legume botanists worldwide to support the 9ILC and participate in planning discussions. Further details will be announced in the coming months. We are thrilled by the prospect of welcoming you to Kunming to continue the tradition of excellence and collaboration embodied by the International Legume Conferences.
