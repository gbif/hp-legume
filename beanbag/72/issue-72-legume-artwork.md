When drawing this, I mostly had *Lathyrus pratensis* in mind with its richly branching stems, unijugate leaves of various sizes, broadly lanceolate leaflets, and semisagittate stipules. However, this species produces several-flowered racemes, so the final drawing is a generalized image of a vetchling. &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; — Andrey Sinjushin

The announcement of the next International Legume Conference prompted me to share a glimpse into the process of designing the 8ILC logo. The images show some of the sketches I made trying to merge a *copaíba* fruit, venn diagrams, and the number 8 (which resembles the infinity symbol) in a single concept. I had a good time making this logo! &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;– Leo Borges
