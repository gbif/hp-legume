# Advances in Legume Systematics 15

**Leonardo Borges** (Universidade Federal de São Carlos), **Marianne le Roux** (South African National Biodiversity Institute, SANBI, South Africa) & **Luciano Queiroz** (Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana, Brazil)

The "Advances in Legume Systematics" series (ALS) stands as a testament to the dedication of the legume community towards advancing our knowledge on legume diversity and evolution. In recent years we have been particularly commited to filling gaps in our knowledge and to strengthen the solid basis layed out in seminal papers published in previous ALS volumes.

In the last five years, two volumes have been published (ALS 13 in 2019, ALS 14 part 1 in 2022; and ALS 14 part 2 in 2024) and a third started to be assembled in 2024. This last volume, ALS 15, is rooted in research presented at the [8th International Legume Conference](www.8ilc.com), held in 2023 in Pirenópolis, Brazil. Following current publishing trends, articles are being released individually upon acceptance and will be soon merged into a Topical Collection of the Brazilian Journal of Botany. While the completion of ALS 15 is in progress, most of its articles are already available at the [journal's website](https://link.springer.com/collections/fhbbcjdidd).

Given its diverse set of topics, ALS 15 will be valuable not only to the legume community but also to botanists broadly interested in legume biology and systematics.
