# ARTIST SPOTLIGHT

## ROSEMARY WISE

**Colin Hughes** (University of Zurich, Switzerland)
<br>
<br>

Rosemary Wise started work as a botanical illustrator in the Department of Plant Sciences at the University of Oxford, U.K., in 1965. She is still drawing and painting plants almost 60 years later.  

Rosemary's work spans plants as well as insects, including both black-and-white line drawings and watercolor paintings. She has illustrated numerous [books, monographs, and scientific papers](https://herbaria.plants.ox.ac.uk/bol/Content/Projects/oxford/Images/listofbooks.pdf). Despite the fact that legumes comprise just a small fraction of her prodigious portfolio, Rosemary has probably illustrated as many legumes as any other botanical artist. She has assembled monographic sets of botanical drawings for a substantial set of legume genera alongside miscellaneous individual legume species, illustrating well over 600 legume species in total. These include large, and in some cases comprehensive, sets of drawings for the genera *Amicia*, *Andira*, *Gliricidia*, *Inga*, *Leucaena*, *Lupinus*, and *Parkia*, alongside a complete set of African 'Acacias,' i.e., all the *Vachellia* and *Senegalia* species of Africa.  

Rosemary was awarded the prestigious annual international Jill Smythies Award for published botanical illustration by the Linnean Society of London. Ten years ago, to celebrate her 50 years at Plant Sciences in Oxford, she was awarded the Sibthorp Medal for "lifetime services to botany" by the University of Oxford.
