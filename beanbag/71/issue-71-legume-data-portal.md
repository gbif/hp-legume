The [Legume Data Portal](https://www.legumedata.org/) continues to actively publish news from the legume systematics community and to host updated versions of the [legume species checklist](https://www.legumedata.org/taxonomy/species-list/) (see Taxonomy Working Group report).

The Legume Data Portal, supported by [Canadensys](https://www.canadensys.net/) and GBIF, runs as an instance of GBIF's hosted portal service ([https://www.gbif.org/hosted-portals](https://www.gbif.org/hosted-portals)). The portal is currently available in English and French, and we have begun translation into Portuguese. We are also keenly interested in seeing the translation of the portal into Spanish. If you wish to help with translations into Portuguese or Spanish, or if you would like to contribute to content, please contact us! There is tremendous scope to expand the Portal with other sorts of legume data beyond the current legume species checklist and species occurrence data.

In the coming months, we intend to put in place a more direct communication mode with members of the legume systematics community. This will allow us to contact you when news items are posted and relevant information (about meetings, scholarships, publications, etc.) becomes available. Please check that your email contact information is up to date and don't hesitate to encourage new members to email us with their contact information.

For now, we would like to highlight an [important post](https://www.legumedata.org/post/2024/taxonomychecklistprocedures/) on the Portal that describes the procedures for checking and updating taxonomic names (see Legume Taxonomy Working Group report for more information). You'll also see an update regarding a project to renew the classification of Papilionoideae. Visit the Portal for this and other news!

Send us your news items and announcements (outstanding publications, new projects, positions available in your legume research group, meetings, activities, etc.) to post on the Legume Data Portal. News items get published regularly on the Portal alongside the annual BeanBag Newsletter. The entire community appreciates your contributions!
