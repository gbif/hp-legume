# WELCOME NOTE

## Issue 71: From the Editors

**Leonardo Borges** (Universidade Federal de São Carlos, Brazil) & **Stephen Boatwright** (University of the Western Cape, South Africa)
<br> 

with contributions by **Brian du Preez** (University of Cape Town, South Africa) & **Marcus Falcão** (Jardim Botânico do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)
<br>
<br>

This new issue celebrates the **50th anniversary of the Bean Bag!** 

The newsletter started in 1974 on the initiative of Charles (Bob) Gunn and Richard Cowan, with the first printed issue distributed in May 1975. The aim of the annual newsletter is to keep legume researchers informed about new publications, events and projects focused on the systematics of the Leguminosae. 

Volume 71 follows the trend of previous issues showing that the legume community keeps pushing the limits on our joint endeavour to understand more about the diversity, ecology and evolution of this beautiful family.

This year's Bean Bag includes reports from the Legume Phylogeny Working Group, six announcements, two digests of 2024 legume papers written by postgraduate students, portraits of three leguminologists in the Gallery of Leguminologists, a spotlight on one botanical artist, new legume species highlights from 2024, a photo gallery and the annual compilation of legume literature in the 2024 bibliography. Also, check out the many photos of spectacular legumes in this issue.

Don't forget to keep an eye on the [Legume Data Portal](https://www.legumedata.org/), which also posts news items of interest to the legume community. You can read more about the Portal in this issue of the Bean Bag.

A big thank you to everybody involved in assembling the Gallery of Leguminologists —a very interesting window into the lives of fellow leguminologists— and to Colin Hughes for taking care of the Artist spotlight and the New Legume Species. We also thank Carole Sinou for assistance with posting the Bean Bag to the Legume Data Portal; Gwilym Lewis at Kew for reviewing parts of this issue and facilitating the archiving of the Bean Bag in the Kew Research Repository, and to our many contributors for sharing their time and insights.

Thanks also to you, the legume community as a whole, for keeping a bright light pointing the way forward in the investigation of legume diversity during the last 50 years. Without your efforts, highlighted in the continuous growth of each year's legume bibliography, there would be no news for us to share.
