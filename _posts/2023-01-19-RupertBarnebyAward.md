The Rupert Barneby Award, named in honor of the late NYBG scientist and renowned legume expert, consists of US$2000 granted annually to assist researchers to visit the New York Botanical Garden to study the rich herbarium collection of Leguminosae.

Projects that will result in the improved curation of the collection are desirable. 

Anyone interested in applying for the award should submit the following: 
1) curriculum vitae; 
2) a proposal describing the project for which the award is sought; 
3) contact information for two individuals who can vouch for the qualifications of the applicant.

2) body of the proposal of no more than two pages, including justification, objectives, and research plan; 
3) literature cited; 
4) travel budget. 

Please email your application to Dr. Benjamin M. Torke (<btorke@nybg.org>) no later than **April 1, 2023** for consideration for the upcoming Award.
