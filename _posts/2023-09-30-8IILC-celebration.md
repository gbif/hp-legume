The 8ILC Organizing Committee has selected seven Brazilian legume researchers who have contributed significantly to the advancement of knowledge about the legume family throughout their careers, by publishing widely on the systematics and phylogenetics of the family and by teaching and mentoring the next generation of students. The 8ILC Organizing Committee also recognized three major plant collectors, each having collected more than 3000 legume numbers, for their contribution to legume research.
