We are pleased to announce that the 8th International Legume Conference will take place from 6 to 11 August 2023 in Piren√≥polis, Brazil. We have set up a [website](https://www.8ilc.com/) where you can fill a form with some basic information. We encourage the legume community to fill this form, which will help us to organize the conference and estimate the number of people attending the event. The organizing committee is currently working on the scientific and social programs, so we hope to have another memorable International Legume Conference. More information will follow soon on our website, but meanwhile: save the date!
 
We are looking forward to seeing you in Brazil next year!!
 
Marcelo Simon (Chair-person), on behalf of the 8ILC organizing committee.
