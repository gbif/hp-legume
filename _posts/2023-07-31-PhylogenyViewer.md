GBIF introduces a phylogenetic tree visualization to celebrate the 8th International Legume Conference (8ILC) on August 6 to 11 2023 in Piern√≥polis, Brazil.

This experimental tool allows the user to explore legume phylogeny in combination with occurrence data from the GBIF network. This ongoing research and development project builds its predecessors [PhyloJive](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btu024) and [PhyloLink][https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty792).

This visualization tool combines the recent [Ringelberg et al. 2023](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ade4954) phylogeny of Mimosoid legumes and aligns it with GBIF occurrence data. The visualization tool matched the tree tip terminals and some internal nodes to the GBIF taxonomy. We then use the taxonomic match to map occurrence data from GBIF for that taxon. For an individual species this is identical to a species map on GBIF.org. 

The novelty is that an entire clade can be mapped with a single click and that multiple clades, such as sister clades, can be mapped in different colors.  We have included several tools to navigate the tree, change maps views and colors and to download the resulting occurrences from a clade.

This is the first step of several phylogentic related advances to be introduced over the rest of 2023.  Pleae give it a try and send feedback to phylogeny@gbif.org
