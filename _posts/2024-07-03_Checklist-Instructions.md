Introduction

As legume researchers, we all need access to an accurate species list for gathering occurrence and trait data in a consistent manner and for curating all other types of data on legumes (phylogenomics, images, etc.). For this reason, in 2020 we initiated a project to update the legume list of names through an ongoing process with the aim to establish an up-to-date, consensus legume checklist with accepted names. The information that we gather will inform our own research as well as that of others, e.g. online projects such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), Catalogue of Life (CoL) and World Flora Online (WFO). The corrections we provide are fully integrated in Kew’s Plants of the World Online (POWO) portal via their World Checklist of Vascular Plants (WCVP) database by collaborating with Rafaël Govaerts, and are synchronised with the International Plant Name Index (IPNI). This document serves to provide a set of instructions that will guide taxonomists to enlist and become part of this global initiative.
