[An expert curated global legume checklist improves the accuracy of occurrence, biodiversity and taxonomic data](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01812-6) has recently been published in the peer-reviewed open-access journal Scientific Data, published by Nature. This paper is the result of work by [The Legume Phylogeny Working Group's Taxonomy Working Group](https://www.legumedata.org/working-groups/taxonomy/) and includes a community endorsed global legume checklist that will serve as a primary source of taxa for biodiversity data platforms and legume-related research. The checklist was published in June 2021, recognising 772 genera and 22,360 species. It is disseminated through the new Legume Data Portal as part of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) hosted portal initiative.
