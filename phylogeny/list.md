title: Open Tree of Life Synthetic Legume Phylogeny
description: |
  The Legume Data Portal and GBIF have teamed up with Open Tree of Life (OToL) to create a curated synthetic phylogeny of the legume family.

## Fabaceae phylogenetics and Open Tree of Life

Fabaceae researchers have published hundreds of phylogenies of component clades within the Fabaceae; however, building a speices level phylogney from a single dataset is still an ellusive goal. [Open Tree of Life](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/about/open-tree-of-life) (OToL) aims to construct a comprehensive, dynamic, and digitally available tree of life by synthesizing published phylogenetic trees along with taxonomic data.

The legume portal and GBIF are collaborating with the [Open Tree of Life](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/about/open-tree-of-life) to create synthetic phylogenetic trees which combines data from many individual phylogenies in a single hypotheiss of relationships.

OToL's main product is a large, all of life, [synthetic tree](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/opentree/argus/opentree14.7@ott93302), with nearly 2.4 million tips. OToL recently developed a protocol for the curation of smaller subset clades, such as the Fabaceae, using tree collections individually curated by its user community.

Read more about how OToL generates synthetic phylogenies. Please upload and curate your phylogenies of any clade to improve our knowledge of the evolutionary history of life. Access OToL curation [here](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/curator).

## Current synthetic phylogeny of Fabaceae

This tree was generated using the [Fabaceae OToL Synthetic Tree Curation](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/curator/collection/view/acaciamulga/fabaceae) page and the 24 input trees listed below. It contains over 5,000 Fabaceae speices. It is a demonstration of the utility of curation process and many more trees need to be added.  As new Fabaceae phylogenies are published to OToL, they be used to update and add species to the overall synthetic tree.

WARNING: OToL currently uses a different taxonomy from the legume portal and GBIF.  Therefore some names may be different then you might expect. Our longer term goal is to align these taxonomies.

## Input phylogenies to the current synthetic tree 
Below is a list of phylogonies in the order they were used in [Fabaceae OToL Synthetic Tree Curation](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/curator/collection/view/acaciamulga/fabaceae) page
